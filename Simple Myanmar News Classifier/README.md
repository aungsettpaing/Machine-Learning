# Introduction

This project is named as <b>Simple Myanmar News Classifier</b>. It classifies myanmar news into five categories :
1. Business
2. Crime
3. Editorial
4. Entertainment
5. Politics

Multinomial Naive Bayes method is used as an classifier in this project with the accuray rate of about 92%

# Purpose

The main purpose of this project is that the very entry level students like me can test their own classification systems with or without help from this project.

# Usage

It is only required to run the file "SMNC Model Usage.ipynb" (https://github.com/aungsettpaing/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Simple%20Myanmar%20News%20Classifier/SMNC%20Model%20Usage.ipynb) provided you want to test the model with your own testing news.

If you want to know how the model is constructed, then please check this file "SMNC Model Construction.ipynb" (https://github.com/aungsettpaing/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Simple%20Myanmar%20News%20Classifier/SMNC%20Model%20Construction.ipynb).
